# Firebase Analytics

The `tabris-plugin-firebase` plugin project provides a [Tabris.js](https://tabrisjs.com) API to track app usage via [firebase analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/). The tracked data is available in the firebase console. The plugin support screen and event tracking as well as user properties.

## Enable analytics tracking
By default the plugin does _NOT_ track any usage data. You have to enable analytics tracking by setting `analyticsCollectionEnabled` to `true`:

```js
firebase.Analytics.analyticsCollectionEnabled = true;
```

## Example

The following example shows typical usage of the analytics API:

```js
// enable analytics data collection (has to be done upfront)
firebase.Analytics.analyticsCollectionEnabled = true;

// provide more details about the current user
firebase.Analytics.setUserPoperty(`power_user`, true);

// track event triggered by user
firebase.Analytics.logEvent('view_item', {description: 'full_membership'});
```

## API

The firebase analytics API is represented as the global object `firebase.Analytics`.
