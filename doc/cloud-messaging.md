# Firebase Cloud Messaging

The `tabris-plugin-firebase` plugin project provides a [Tabris.js](https://tabrisjs.com) API to receive [firebase cloud messages](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/). The plugin allows to receive notification data when the app is in the foreground or to automatically display a notification when the app is not running or in the background. Currently only Android is supported with iOS support coming in the future.

## Example

The following snippet shows how the `tabris-plugin-firebase` plugin can be used to receive a cloud message in a Tabris.js app.

```js
console.log('Token to send to backend: ' + firebase.Messaging.token);

firebase.Messaging.on('tokenChanged',
    ({token}) => console.log('Server token refreshed: ' + token));

firebase.Messaging.on('message',
    ({data}) => console.log('Received message data: ' + JSON.stringify(data)));

console.log('Message data from app cold start: ' + firebase.Messaging.launchData);
```

A more elaborate example can be found in the [example](../example/) folder. It provides a Tabris.js cordova project that demonstrates the various features of the `tabris-plugin-firebase` integration. When building the example project make sure to run `npm install` inside its `www` folder to fetch the Tabris.js dependencies.

To [send a message](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/send-message) from the server side a `curl` command similar to the following `POST` request can be used:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: key=<server-key>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "to": "<token>",
    "data": {
      "title": "New data",
      "body": "The new data arrived",
      "payload": "custom data"
    }
  }
' https://fcm.googleapis.com/fcm/send
```

### Custom notification icon (optional)

An Android [notification icon](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_status_bar.html) can be provided via the plugin variable `ANDROID_NOTIFICATION_ICON`. To configure a notification icon a resource id of an Android drawable inside the Android platforms `res` folder has to be specified. A build hook can be used to copy the notification icon from your project into the `android` platform `res` folder. See the [example project](../example/cordova/scripts/android/copy-resources.js) for a snippet to get you started.

The icon can be configured inside your apps `config.xml`:

```xml
<plugin name="tabris-plugin-firebase" spec="1.0.0">
  <variable name="ANDROID_NOTIFICATION_ICON" value="@drawable/ic_notification" />
</plugin>
```

Alternatively the image can be added during the `cordova plugin add` command:

```bash
cordova plugin add <path-to-tabris-firebase-plugin> --variable ANDROID_NOTIFICATION_ICON=`icon_drawable_name`
```

When no notification icon is specified, the outline of the app icon is used.

## Send message with notification from server

When the server sends a message to a device it can create two types of messages: "notification" messages and "data" messages. Messages that contain a `notification` key in its json payload are treated as "notification" message. More details of the differences between "notification" and "data" messages can be found in the [firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#notifications_and_data_messages).

The key difference for this plugin is that "notification" messages create their notification automatically when the app is in the background. Tapping on the notification _does not forward the notification data to the app_.

To create a notification that also delivers its data to the app, when the notification is tapped, a regular "data" notification has to be created. A "data" message does _not_ have a key `notification`.

To configure the notification several properties can be set:

- `id` : `number`
- `title` : `string`
- `body` : `string`

The following message send from a server would create a notification similar to the [screenshot](doc/img/firebase.png) above:

```shell
POST /fcm/send HTTP/1.1
Host: fcm.googleapis.com
Authorization: key=<server-key>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "to": "<token>",
  "data": {
    "title": "New data available",
    "body": "The new data can be used in a multitude of ways",
    "payload": "custom data"
  }
}
```

Note that the json object above does not contain a `notification` key. It only provides the `to` key to declare the message receiver and the data payload send to the app.

Using the same `id` for multiple messages updates an existing notification on the users device. Omitting the `id` creates a random id on the device so that each message results in a unique notification.

## API

The firebase messaging API is represented as the global object `firebase.Messaging`.

### `Messaging`

#### Properties

All `Messaging` properties are read only.

##### `instanceId` : _string_

* A stable identifier that uniquely identifies the app installation. Note that on Android the instance id can become invalid as noted in the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/iid/FirebaseInstanceId.html).

##### `token` : _string_

* A registration `token` to be used on the server side to address an app installation. The registration `token` is usually available but can change during the apps lifetime. To get notified of a registration token updates you should listen for `tokenChanged` events. When resetting the `instanceId`, the token is not available until the `tokenChanged` event fired.

##### `launchData` : _object_

* Contains the cloud message data when the app is cold started from a notification. There are two scenarios of message data delivery:
  1. When the app is in the foreground (or running in the background and the user taps on the notification) the `message` event callback is invoked.
  2. In case the app process is not running and the app is freshly launched (cold started) from a notification, the data contained within that notification is available in the `launchData` object.

* The recommended way to make sure your app receives all messaging data is to check the `firebase.Messaging.launchData` object on app startup and to register for the `message` event to receive follow-up messages.

#### Events

##### `instanceIdChanged`

* The `instanceIdChanged` event is fired asynchronously when the `resetInstanceId()` method is invoked.

###### Event Parameters:

* `target` : _Messaging_
  * The `Messaging` object which allows to interact with firebase cloud messaging
* `instanceId` : _string_
  * The new `instanceId` of the app

##### `tokenChanged`

* The `tokenChanged` event is fired when the current registration token has changed. Check the firebase [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/iid/FirebaseInstanceId.html) for details when that might be the case.

###### Event Parameters:

* `target` : _Messaging_
  * The `Messaging` object which allows to interact with firebase cloud messaging
* `token` : _string_
  * The new registration `token` to send to backend server

##### `message`

* The `message` event is fired when a cloud message is received by a running app. This can either be while the app is in the foreground or the user clicks on a notification while the app is running in the background. To get the message data while the app is cold launched from a notification see the `launchData` property.

###### Event Parameters:

* `target` : _Messaging_
  * The `Messaging` object which allows to interact with firebase cloud messaging
* `data` : _object_
  * The message `data` object as send from the server side

#### Methods

##### `resetInstanceId()`

* Invalidates the current `instanceId` and creates a new one asynchronously. To be notified when a new `instanceId` is available you should listen for the `instanceIdChanged` event. Resetting the `instanceId` also resets the associated registration `token`. A `tokenChanged` event will be fired once a new token is available.
